## **Jewelry Price Prediction - Machine Learning App**


## **Project Overview**
This project aims to predict jewelry prices using machine learning models. It leverages historical sales data, competitor pricing, and customer demographics to build an AI-driven pricing strategy. The model helps jewelry businesses optimize pricing for maximum profitability while remaining competitive.

### **Core Features**
**Single Prediction**: Enter jewelry attributes and get an estimated price.

**Bulk Predictions**: Upload CSV/Excel files for multiple predictions.

**Data Visualization**: Interactive dashboard for insights.

**Export Predictions**: Save results in CSV, Excel, PDF, and Word formats.

**User-Friendly UI**: Beautiful Streamlit interface designed for a jewelry store.

## **Problem Statement**
Gemineye Emporium, a growing jewelry business, faces pricing challenges due to rapid expansion. 

## The Key issues include:

- **Market Dynamics**: Consumer preferences and trends change frequently.

- **Competitive Pricing**: Setting prices to attract customers while maintaining profitability.

- **Cost Management**: Balancing material costs, craftsmanship, and logistics.

The goal is to develop a `machine learning` model that predicts optimal jewelry prices based on various attributes.

## **Dataset Information**

The dataset contains details about jewelry orders, including:

The following are the feature	description
- `Category`:	Type of jewelry (Necklace, Ring, etc.)
- `Brand_ID`:	Unique identifier for brands
- `Target_Gender`:	Intended gender for the jewelry
- `Main_Color`:	Primary color of the jewelry piece
- `Main_Metal`:	Main metal used (Gold, Silver, etc.)
- `Main_Gem`:	Gemstone type (Diamond, Ruby, etc.)
- `Order Month`:	Month in which the order was placed
- `Order Day`:	Day of the month when the order was placed
- `Price (Target)`:	The jewelry price in USD

## **Tech Stack**
The project is built using:

- **`Python`** üêç

- **`Machine Learning Models`**: Catboost Regressor, Linear Regression, Extra-Trees, Decision Trees, Adaboost Regressor
  
- **`Data Preprocessing`**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn

= **`Visualization`**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

## **Experiment Tracking**: `MLflow`

## **Deployment**: `Streamlit, Render, GitHub`

- Machine Learning Workflow (CRISP-DM Approach)

1. Business Understanding
- Define pricing challenges for the jewelry market.

- Collaborate with stakeholders to align business goals with AI-driven pricing.

2. Data Collection & Preprocessing
- Collect historical sales data, competitor pricing, and customer demographics.

- Handle missing values, remove outliers, and encode categorical features.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyze seasonality, pricing trends, and consumer preferences.

- Identify key features affecting jewelry prices.

4. Feature Engineering
- Create new features to improve model accuracy.

- Scale numeric features and encode categorical variables.

5. Model Training & Evaluation
Implemented Models include :

- Linear Regression

- Decision Tree

 -Extra Trees

- AdaBoost

- CatBoost

**Evaluation Metrics**:

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

- R¬≤ Score

## **Hyperparameter Tuning using GridSearchCV for performance improvement**.

6. Experiment Tracking with MLflow
Track different models and hyperparameter tuning results.

Compare model performance and log metrics.

7. Model Deployment
Deploying the best model using Streamlit & Render.

Created an interactive UI for users to enter jewelry details and get predictions.
